                        Since the establishment of this organisation we've tried our very best to help our community and our people as much as we can, here's how: With roughly 20 000 people visiting our website every month and over 25 security courses like: 6 Door Supervisor courses, 6 Upskilling courses, 3 CCTV Operator courses, 6 Security Guarding courses, 3 First Aid courses and 3 Personal Licence courses etc to choose from in a month, which leads to around 6000 qualifications issued every year we're really trying to make the difference.
